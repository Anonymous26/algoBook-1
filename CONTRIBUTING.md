## Bugs Resporting or Feature Requests

Notice a mistake? Please file any bugs, requests, or questions in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/algobook/algobook/issues)!
We appreciate your effort to improve algoBook by submitting a bug report. Before doing so, please check the following things: 

1. Check whether the bug you face **hasn't been already reported**. Duplicate reports takes us time, that we could be used to fix other bugs or make improvements. 
2. Specify the browser and OS information that may be helpful to fix the problem. 
3. If you got some error, please **describe what happened** and add error message. Reports like "I get error when I clicked on some link." are useless. 
4. Provide easy steps to reproduce.
